* DIY Laptop

** Design goals
 1. Easy to build
 2. Customizable
 3. Not overly expensive
 4. Uses a pi for the first iteration, because I own one and it's super supported.

    
** Ideas

*** Case Ideas
   1. Dowel Sticks
      | Pros             | Cons                                |
      | Cheap            | Assembly still required             |
      | Easy to assemble | Easy to not make structurally sound |
      | Modular          | Still need some sort of Enclosure   |
   2. Use existing laptop
      | Pros                    | Cons                                                        |
      | Nice Laptop form factor | Difficult to customize                                      |
      | Very little assembly    | Have to use existing spaces for ports                       |
      |                         | Battery might need to be replaced, and takes up weird space |
      |                         | Not much internal space                                     |

   3. Briefcase, secondhand
      | Pros                                          | Cons                                               |
      | Lots of space                                 | Cooling, and Material                              |
      | Rigid(hopefully)                              | Base might be too big for comfortable keyboard use |
      | Looks freaken cool                            | Have to rip out a lot of material                  |
      | Extremely little assembly for first prototype |                                                    |
      
*** Battery Ideas
   1. 18650 battery array
      | Pros                     | Cons                                     |
      | Customizable             | Diffcult to charge                       |
      | Potentially more wattage | Dangerous(Looking at you samsung)        |
      |                          | Expensive                                |
      |                          | Difficult to wire together               |
      |                          | need special circuitry for even charging |
   
   2. Power Bank
      | Pros                                     | Cons                          |
      | Comes with everything you need to use it | Might not have enough wattage |
      | Relatively cheap                         | Hard to add more wattage      |


*** Screens 
   The screen, has to be a laptop screen. For power
   
*** Screen Controller
   Needs more research, I thought there was a generic one, but I can't find it. 
   If there isn't, I should find a screen first.
   

*** Computer Board
    Already decided on raspberry pi, because I own one. But these are things I can use in future.
    1. Nuc Board. e.g. https://www.takealot.com/asus-am1i-a-all-in-one-am1-motherboard/PLID42171411?gclid=CjwKCAjw8qjnBRA-EiwAaNvhwMKKxJvBtSad3gAfeRKheVEtzgy5xkzkw3WpvV738mfIXOaVyU-wCxoCnbsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds
    2. One of these https://all3dp.com/1/single-board-computer-raspberry-pi-alternative/
    3. Use something like nvidia jetson, it has a nice graphics card but it caters mostly to machine learning.

** Useful Research
 1. Frank Adams https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe4wHZ5WmNKMgqWiIblZ14g  
   * Built a laptop SBC computer
 2. Pitop, raspberry pi computer. But they miss the point, it's not modular enough and only supports pis
 3. DIY laptop kit for kids https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-kM5lQ0BIE&t=474s. 
   * Uses a raspberry pi and has a super simple setup. 
   * Simplicity is what I want to aim for, and this has it in abundance.
